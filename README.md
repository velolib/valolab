## Intro

valolab is a simple agent composition visualizer for VALORANT. I made it because I got tired of using tier lists to think about team comps. Instead of ranking agents, Valolab lets you quickly put together and visualize compositions for different maps, making it easier to experiment with ideas and plan setups without overthinking it.

## Local Development

Use your preferred package manager.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
